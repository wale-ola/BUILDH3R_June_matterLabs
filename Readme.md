# Build smart contract

This learning experience equipped me with a robust foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. 

Through practical exercises and progress updates on GitHub, I acquired hands-on experience and developed a representative code portfolio. 

I learned to create ERC20 tokens, handle hashed messages on the blockchain, and automate contract interactions with ethers.js. 

Furthermore, I examined the use of zkSync and paymasters for transaction fee management and token balance oversight.
